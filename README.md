Installation Guide
In this project, we will set up everything required to run an integrated AI model with a smart contract. We will train the model using TensorFlow, deploy the smart contract with Truffle, and then interact with the model and contract through a web interface using Web3.js.

Step 1: Setting up the AI Environment
Install Python and TensorFlow: First, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. Then, install the TensorFlow library using the requirements.txt file.

Open your terminal, navigate to the ai_model/ folder, and install the dependencies using pip:


cd ai_model
pip install -r requirements.txt
requirements.txt contains all the dependencies for TensorFlow, such as:

tensorflow==2.7.0
numpy==1.21.2
Train the Model:

After installing the dependencies, train the model using the model.py script:

python model.py
After training is complete, the trained model will be saved in the mnist_model.h5 file located in the ai_model/ folder.

Step 2: Setting up the Smart Contract
Install Truffle and Node.js:

Install Truffle, a framework for developing smart contracts using Solidity. First, ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, install Truffle globally using npm:

npm install -g truffle
Set up the Smart Contract:

Go to the smart_contract/ directory and install the smart contract dependencies:

cd smart_contract
npm install
Deploy the Smart Contract:

To deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum network (e.g., Rinkeby or Ganache), you need to configure Truffle with your mnemonic (the recovery phrase for your wallet) and Infura if you're using Rinkeby.

If using Ganache (local network), open Ganache and connect it to Truffle:

truffle migrate --network ganache
If you're using Rinkeby or Infura, ensure your truffle-config.js is set up correctly (include your mnemonic and Infura).

Then, deploy the contract using:

truffle migrate --network rinkeby
This will deploy the contract to the network.

Step 3: Setting up Web3.js Integration
Install Web3.js:

To interact with the smart contract, you'll need Web3.js:

Go to the web3_integration/ folder and install the dependencies with npm:

cd web3_integration
npm install
Set up the Web Interface:

After installing the dependencies, you can open the index.html file in your browser, but first, ensure Metamask or another Ethereum wallet is connected to the correct Ethereum network.

Modify the code in app.js to interact with the smart contract using Web3.js, making sure to include the ABI (Application Binary Interface) and the contract address (which is available after deployment).

Run the Local Server:

To run a local server, you can use lite-server or any other server of your choice to serve the index.html file.

If you're using lite-server, first install it with:

npm install lite-server --save-dev
Then add the following to your package.json:

"scripts": {
  "start": "lite-server"
}
Now, to run the local server:

npm start
Step 4: Running the Project
Ensure you have trained the AI model and saved it as mnist_model.h5.

Make sure the smart contract is successfully deployed using Truffle.

Run index.html on your local server with Web3.js to interact with the smart contract.

Notes:
Make sure Metamask or your Ethereum wallet is connected to the correct network, such as Rinkeby or Ganache.

If you're using Rinkeby or Infura, ensure Truffle is configured properly in truffle-config.js.

Step 5: Building with Docker (Optional)
If you'd like to run the project with Docker, you can build the container using docker-compose:

Make sure you're in the root of the project, and then run:


docker-compose up
The docker-compose.yml will spin up the containers for the AI model, Smart contract, and Web interface.

 you'll be able to run the entire project, connect the AI model to the smart contract, and interact with it through a Web3.js interface.
